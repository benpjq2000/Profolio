        <h2>Research on High Pricing Smartphone</h2>
        <p>Abstract: Since the introduction of the iPhone X, we have seen more and more phones that
are priced at about $1000, and some of them are priced at about $2000. However, are these
phones too expensive for most people? Many people do not want to buy these phones
because, in some places around the world, people think these phones are too expensive. In
addition, what benefits do the companies get when they price these phones this way? Thus,
we can take Apple as an example. By evaluating the financial report from Apple, this paper
aims to find out whether or not this kind of strategy is successful. Then, it suffices to show
that by increasing the products' prices, the products' profits also increase. Thus, this strategy
can be very successful since Apple has become the company with the highest market value. In
addition, since the cost of production has increased dramatically, Apple needs high prices to
keep the revenue stable. In some cases, these phones may not be overpriced.
